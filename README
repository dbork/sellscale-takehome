Setup

To run SellScaleHood, you will need installations of the following:

- python3
- npm
- Node >= 14
- flask

You will also need two open terminal windows. Run the following commands in
the first terminal window from the top-level directory:

$ source venv/bin/activate
$ npm start

This will activate the virtual environment in which the required Python 
packages are installed, and will launch the Flask development server on 
127.0.0.1:5000. Then, in a second terminal window, run

$ cd sellscalehood
$ npm start

to run the React frontend at 127.0.0.1:3000. This will also open a tab in
your default Web browser, from which SellScaleHood can be used.
