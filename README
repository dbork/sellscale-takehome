Setup

To run SellScaleHood, you will need installations of the following:

- python3
- npm
- Node >= 14
- flask

First, you will need to set up a Python virtual environment. From the top-level
directory, run

$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the required Python packages and activate the resulting
virtual environment. Next, run

$ flask run

to launch the Flask development server on 127.0.0.1:5000. 

Then, in a second terminal window, run

$ cd sellscalehood
$ npm start

to run the React frontend at 127.0.0.1:3000. This will also open a tab in
your default Web browser, from which SellScaleHood can be used.
